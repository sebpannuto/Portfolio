# Portfolio
The files in the repository are a collection of coding assignments that I have done throughout my 4 years at college. They range from simple assignments to the more complex ones. Below is a descriptition of each assignment to get a better understanding as to what each assignment does:


**Sebastian Pannuto Capstone**

In this folder is my Senior Project. This is a web application that is based around nutrition. It allows users to create an account, search for foods, and then add them to their meal plan. All of their information is stored in an SQL Database and can be accessed at any time. The code was written in JAVA and JSF and the whole application is stored on an EC2 Instance on AWS. 

The application can be accessed here: [healthnutritionee.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com](healthnutritionee.us-east-1.elasticbeanstalk.com)

**Prog 7**

In this folder is an interactive fiction engine I wrote in python. The program uses pulls parameters from an SQLite3 database file and then is able to build the game around those parameters.
